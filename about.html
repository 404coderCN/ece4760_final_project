    Hi there, I'm a glove-controlled robot hand designed at Cornell by Jerry Jin, Caroline Huang, and Canwen Zhang. 
    My body is fully 3D printed and I can move all five of my fingers! My fingers are controlled by five servos in the 
    arm and I listen to the command from whoever is wearing the control glove:) Wanna know more about how I work? Please 
    read more from this website! Checkout a video of me 
    on <a class="highlight-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2LN8rhvrco&list=PLDqMkB5cbBA6AwYC_DElkDStUdOsTuIL7&index=33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> YouTube </a>. 
    You can also find my source code on <a class="highlight-link" href="https://jamstackthemes.dev/theme/jekyll-neumorphism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Github</a>.
